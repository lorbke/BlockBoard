# General

We built a platform connecting individuals selling advertising space to businesses looking to advertise. Individuals will profit from earning passive income, while companies will profit from cheap ad-prices.
To realize our project, we implemented four different interconnected layers.
- Frontend
- Backend
- Smart Contracts
- Hardware

# Project Setup Guide

Due to the complexity of the project (we barely got it working) and the fact that hardware is required, it is not recommended to setup the project yourself and we provide no guide. To get an overview over what we did, we recommend watching the demo video at Devfolio.
